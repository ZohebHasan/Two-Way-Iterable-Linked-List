Implemented a fully functional generic abstract data type, by using two-way iterable nodes and only an Iterable interface (from the java
library to maintain the hierarchy contract). The client code will allow the user to traverse their data both frontwards and backward by using
a custom-implemented two-way list iteratorâ€™s APIs and add or remove elements with a linear time complexity - O(n)

The corner cases are functional and the time complexity of this implementation is promising.
